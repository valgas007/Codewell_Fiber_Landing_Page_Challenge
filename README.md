# THIS IS A CODEWELL FRONTEND CHALLENGE I AM TRYING OUT

### FIBRE LANDING PAGE

the idea is to build an online portfolio generator. In this challenge, the following languages will be used:
- Html
- CSS

The design will contain optimal designs for screen sizes ranging from mobile to desktop, each having both a landing page and a registration page

The design will incorporate a mobile first approach
please note that this design was made without the figma file so it is based on eye judgement as far as colors, paddings, box sizes and margins go
